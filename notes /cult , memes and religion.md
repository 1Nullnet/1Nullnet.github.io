# SOME SIMILAR PATTERNS IN CULT, MEMES AND RELIGION
I was in a mosque listening to the Imam (who leads the prayers). There is a tradition to give social lectures and connect them to Islamic principles, learnings, and guidance for the people.

What made me curious is that I was seeing patterns in his speech, similar to an orator or a cult leader.

Here are the patterns I observed:

1) US VS THEM
   
In cults, this is the core. The leader convinces weak, vulnerable, damaged, etc., kinds of people that they know the truth, and that those who oppose the truth and their sayings are evil, bad, or not like us.

We see this pattern in religion. Someone who is drinking, cursing, or doing anything bad is influenced by SATAN or THE DEVIL. This creates a boundary or a separation between the believers and the unbelievers. The unbelievers are thought to be possessed by the devil because they go against the beliefs.

2) THE SAVIOUR
   
Many cult leaders perform like a saviour. For example, "if you join me you will be saved from the afterlife," or "if you join me, you can be immortal." These sentences attack the vulnerable, or to elaborate, they attack our core fears: the unpredictable, the afterlife, death, etc. This fear hinders our mind, and we struggle to find an answer, a safe side.

It's like in the cold we desire to have a blanket; if in that situation someone gives us a blanket, we will think that he/she is an angel.

Religion also exploits these fears I talked about earlier. It gives us meaning and a safe spot. "God knows best," and "all your life is already decided," makes us think that we are safe, and that whatever bad or good happens is for a reason. It's an indirect way to accept situations when they happen.

3) NARRATIVES/STORIES
   
We know very well that religion uses stories to influence us, which is a very powerful tool to convey beliefs. Their stories are crafted in a way that makes us feel positive and drawn to them.

It sets examples, provides evidences, stories, and even proofs (illogical or logical) to influence and create a strong perception in our minds.

Cults do this by, for example, paying an actor to act ill and then "treating" them in front of the crowd, or claiming to fly with a rope that cannot be seen. These physical narratives are very powerful because we often say "if I don't see it, I don't believe it." However, ideas (not innovative ideas, but concepts, thoughts, stories, etc.) spread through a community. People talk about it, and it spreads like a virus. To elaborate, suppose a cult leader plants an idea in his few trusted believers that he is immortal. Then the believers talk about it, spreading it via conversations among non-believers, twisting it, adding more realistic imagery and effort, but with the same goal: to plant that particular idea in the masses.

And it does work because of our nature to remember stories better than logic and concepts.

### MEMES AND IDEAS 
I used 'meme' in the title of this writing because a meme, not just as a joke, plays a very crucial role in planting and widely spreading ideas.

Its main components have to be:

1) Compressed:
It must be small, short, and concise.

2) Planting:
Planting works by making a meme in such a way that it is high-stimulus based (emotional, catchy music, intense, etc.)

3) Community:
A community is very important, one that talks about the meme. This gives a sense of social exclusion to people who don't know the meme, and they try to join in or learn the meme idea in order to fit in.
