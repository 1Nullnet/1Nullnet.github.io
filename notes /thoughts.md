which conatains questions , intuatuions , and thoughts 


[OOO AND LINGUSTIC](https://github.com/1Nullnet/1Nullnet.github.io/blob/THOUGHTS/notes%20/ooo%20and%20linguistic.md)
- Here i connect the ooo ( object orineneted ontology ) with lingustic resulting a better view of how our experinces , thinkings and language effects our reality and mind ) 

[ooo ,accelerationism  , and system theory ](https://github.com/1Nullnet/1Nullnet.github.io/blob/THOUGHTS/notes%20/ooo%20%2C%20accelerationism%20%20%2C%20and%20system%20theory%20.md)
- I have used the concept of ooo , and understand power , bodies and instutuions ..how they relate , interact and when it accelerates how it effects the whole connected dynamic ecosystem of world structures

[Transgression and law ](https://github.com/1Nullnet/1Nullnet.github.io/blob/THOUGHTS/notes%20/Transgression%20and%20laws%20.md) Here i show the paradox of why more laws creates more crimes.
