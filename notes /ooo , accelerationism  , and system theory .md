# OOO , ACCELRATIONISM AND SYSTEM THEORY : AN UNDERSTANDING OF INSTITUTIONS AND THERE RELATIONS 


Treating institutions , bodies , and agencies as an isolated object , understanding its structure of how its internal works , and to know its meaning of existence . As ooo ( object orietned ontology ) talks about that objects existence are independent of our perception .Thus a rock , a pen , a goverment body , all can be treated as an object and can be understood by its Reason to exists independent of us .


Objects form relations with each other , studying isolated institutions and then connecting each form each other other we get a holistic understanding of how each object checks and functions with each other .
