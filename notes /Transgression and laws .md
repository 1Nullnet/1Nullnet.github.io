# TRANSGRESSION AND LAW 
## HOW INCREASING LAWS AND RULES PARADOXICALLY INCREASE TRANSGRESSION

This thought came to me as a soltuion of a question i was wondering on which is " Why crimes exist .. and if people know they will get punished , then rationally why they even do it ?'
isnt it a self destructive method , to breack laws .. , so why do it at all ?"

Solution / Answer 

Crime happen or TRANSGRESSION ( act of breacking rules , laws and sociteal norms ) .. because laws and rules confined ones individual , as like of a chain which controls and supress ones will ..the will to freedom as rosseau said is fundamental to any person ..
when the number of rules and laws increases we expect that less crime and TRANSGRESSION  will occur , But a complete opposite happens ... the more the rules , the more supression of ones intend will , the more TRANSGRESSION ..and the more TRANSGRESSION  gives more sense of divine energy of freedom ..
the energy which says ." i am free" 

this energy is addective , .. for example .. as student did a prank on the school , he indeed broke the rules of the school .. but he felt energized , and a sense of freedom that he is not confined anymore ..espacially if he didnt get caught ..
he then most probably will challenge more norms and rules ..and try to hide with it as he is aware of the consequences .

we can also link FREUD  concept of repression and focault idea of fanatnsy and societal taboos .. as how we humans when said " dont do this " , wirting books , argumenets and teaching on why its bad , not right and telling rules .. still its either curosity that we channel our repressed desires because of system control over us
