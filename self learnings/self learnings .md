#### STORY OF HANNIBAL 
Hannibal was a brilliant military commander of the Carthaginian Empire. He was raised never to be a friend of Rome, and because of this, he planned to attack the city from a direction they never imagined.

Rome was safeguarded by the Alps mountains—big, and notoriously difficult to cross. Hannibal made his goal clear: he would attack Rome. The rest was just dynamic problem-solving. The Alps were not an easy journey. In one situation, Hannibal and his army, which included thousands of troops and dozens of elephants, were stopped by a massive rock.

Hannibal didn't cry or think, "I had a dream, and now this rock will shatter it." Instead, he brought the situation under his control with whatever he had at the time. He used fire, igniting it with the vinegar they carried, which resulted in the rock weakening so it could be broken easily. His army then attacked the rock with hammers and carved a path.

This story of Hannibal made a very prominent impact on my mindset towards challenges.

I used to have a negative chain of thoughts. If I couldn't do one thing—like solve a problem on an exam I was preparing for—I would think it would shatter my dream and that I would be a lost cause.

But Hannibal's story showed me that one must keep a goal and always bring problems under one's control during the process, by whatever means one can.

I realized that if a challenge has a solution, then it's called a problem, and yes, we can solve it. But if it doesn't have a solution, it's a crisis; we can't do anything about it, so we must not waste time on it.
