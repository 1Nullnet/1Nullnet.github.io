ANNHILATION OF SELF AND BIRTH OF A CRIMINAL MIND 


**DISCLAIMER: I am not professionally licensed to publish or write a report on criminal behaviour and forensic psychiatry. This is an exploratory essay (non academic and medical ) with no mention (just broad cases, not direct or focused) of real cases, names of victims, or accusers. I will not use sensitive words or phrases related to criminal and violent behaviours, so I will use words like 'harm', 'punish', etc.** 
Its an exploration of how identity collapse effects human behaviour .

### **ABSTRACT / INTRODUCTION**

This is an exploratory essay about an observation that I have made concerning criminal and violent impulsive behaviour. The observation is that even with no trauma history, or mental illness related to any impulsive, emotional, and cognitive problem, individuals can commit violent and even severe self-harming actions.

### **CHAPTER 1: IDENTITY**

Identity is a very fragile and majorly constructed body, built upon societal conditioning and pre-established evolutionary principles in the human mind. Identity is a very existential concept; it makes us what we are. Our way to sit, talk, blink, our music taste, our likes and dislikes, and our unique behaviour with our perception of our world, is totally variable and never equivalent to another person (only partially, through mass beliefs, mass concepts, etc.).

But what if we make our whole identity dependent on one particular object present in the external world? It could be a person, a car, an exam, our social status (which indeed is not a physical object, yet it is external as we try to control and influence it), and many such things. If our whole identity, our happiness, our reason to exist, and our name (internal monologue, or external) is situated with it... what if that object is gone, and not in our control now?

With this, our mind gets an existential danger—an annihilation of self—as if someone ripped our self away. With this enormous, sharp hit, individuals tend toward an impulsive and destructive nature to destroy or harm the object, objects associated with it, or even the self.

We can see many examples of how a partner harms the other partner when he/she goes out of their control or leaves. How the failure of an exam leads to self-harm cases, and the removal of self-existence entirely. We can see many severe and damaging cases of how someone who loved someone did horrible destructive acts to the other when they left.

This complete loss of self triggers our major universal fear of self, the meaninglessness. Our mind cannot be dynamic and constantly change a fragile identity (well, if so, it's a mental illness like DID). As it stands on solid, years of beliefs and conditioning that make our whole identity, it is constantly adding and making new beliefs from our events and experiences to form identity. It is majorly most active from birth to adolescence and even the 20s (formation of morals, life, responsibility, and maturity). It is the critical age of getting beliefs and holding onto them. After that interval, we can say an identity is formed solidly. Here, at this time, the sense of self is strong. Yet if it breaks, it collapses the whole world, as it breaks the whole strong beliefs a person has given to that object, giving rise to criminal behaviours and self-harm.

### **CHAPTER 2: Why do some people associate their entire identity onto an object?**

Well, there could be a reason. That object may have been presented as highly important, and that your whole life depends on it by society—for example, exams or social status such as a car. Or it could be an internal relation with the object, self-made, as it serves all our desires and wants. For example, a person who never got loved or desired proper caring love can project his/her whole identity onto the person who gave love. This particular example shows signs of when the partner isn't giving attention, messaging early, talking, etc. Even though there are many possibilities for why someone is doing so, the partner who devoured his/her whole identity becomes impulsive, compulsive, and fearful of why they are doing that, and has a sense of abandonment.

It is a common known term, 'fear of abandonment', but I am also talking about non-relational issues, such as exams, a car lost, job lost, financial crisis, etc.

In the future, I will look onto more thinkers and read extensively on how identity actually functions when its whole concept is given to an object, to control and possess it.

### **CHAPTER 3: CLINICAL SIGNS**

It is necessary to find the patterns and signs of when a person has his/her whole identity oriented towards an object or idea presented by self or environment (people, family, friends, etc.).

**The signs:**

1. Ask what he/she loves the most (not food, music, or a place, but the deepest love, always a desire to clean, watch, care for it). Why love? Because love is a contrary of our deepest fear. What we love the most, we also fear the most to lose. If that love is so intense that it leads to constant thinking, actions, and a desire for control, keeping it always in front of them (SIGNS OF OCD SITUATED WITH IDENTITY)... then it is dangerous.
    
2. Paranoia of the loss and love. It points to the major sign of how the person is so scared, doubtful, and anxious over the object.

CLINICAL APPROACH : 

1) **The "Object" Attachment Scale:** How could we measure the degree to which someone's identity is fused with an external object? 
2) **The Narrative:** What is the personal story someone tells themselves about this object? (e.g., "This person is my soulmate; without them I am nothing," "This job is my entire value as a person").
    
3) **The Trigger:** The specific event that represents the irreversible loss of control over that object (rejection, failure, financial loss).
    
4)  **The Collapse:** The psychological and neurological process that happens during the "annihilation of self" – the feeling of emptiness, panic, and meaninglessness.
    
5)  **The Impulse Pathway:** How does that feeling of collapse get translated into an impulsive action aimed at destroying the source of pain (the object, the self, or a substitute)?
    



### **TERMINOLOGY CLARIFICATION:**

**Object:** It could be a physical, sensible object literally, or it could be an object in the head which we can say is an idea—an idea planted or self-made—about a particular external object. It is the idea which makes the identity dependent, not the inherent object itself. Previously I have also stated social status as an identity dependence. This could also incline with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), although only one category does not make it an NPD. Yet it is very important that beneath many criminal behaviours, identity is dependent on an object.

### **FUTURE DIRECTION:**

The DSM-5 cannot capture a precise image of such object-dependent identity. Future work should involve real case studies and pattern observation of previously non-mentally ill individuals who committed unlawful acts.

### **CONCLUSION:**

Although it is just an observation and exploration, with precise evaluation, documentation, and observation, a well-established model could be made for understanding "why even healthy people do heinous acts. As this foundation tells us that the person behavioural reason not just pathological but gives a logical description of albeit catastrophic, outcome of a broken meaning-making system.
