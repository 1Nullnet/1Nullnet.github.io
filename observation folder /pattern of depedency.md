# PATTERN OF DEPEDENCY 

WHILE  meta thinking , i realised why i am doing so and so and how this element is controlling me .
i have found three patterns which is used through out history and a very powrful method of dependency 

1) ##  EASY ACCESS
   The element , service , or object which have intend to make others depdent must have an easy way to access and get it into one hands

2) ##  SATISFACTORY TO PERSONAL DESIRES
   It must satisfy personal desires , or needs

3) ## IT MUST BE IRREPLACABLE

   The service provided , must be too important to lose or neglect , as it provides great satisfactory needs and easy access ..

EXAMPLE : smoking( ciggerates ) ...its easily avaliable , sataisfy personal desire and irreplacable ..
BIG TECH COMPANIES .. easy access to data , or services , satisfy needs ( personal goals , projects or querry) and they are irraplacable 

i also must add ... KEEPING UP WITH TRENDS AND MARKET NEEDS OF SERVICES 

this method is very powerful as through out history , empires , milatary , and power ..we have seen the assymetery of demand and service ..if there is demand and only one can give quality , up to date , and easy fast access for personal needs it becomes powerful as it makes others depdent on it
