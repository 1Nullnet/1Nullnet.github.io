# HOW DEMOCRACY WHICH WAS MADE FOR EQUALITY , FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND MANY IDEAL CONCEPTS THOUGHT BY THINKERS , IS NOW EXPLOITATED 

### Part 1: How Thinkers Envisioned Democracy (The Ideal)

The Enlightenment thinkers of the 17th and 18th centuries (like Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, and later, the American Founding Fathers) were reacting against the absolute monarchies and aristocratic regimes of their time. Their vision was revolutionary:

1. **Popular Sovereignty:** The fundamental idea that the legitimacy of the state and its government is created and sustained by the consent of its people, through their elected representatives (e.g., "We the People").
    
2. **Social Contract:** Citizens agree to give up some absolute freedoms and obey the state's laws in exchange for the protection of their natural rights (life, liberty, property).
    
3. **Separation of Powers:** To prevent the concentration of power and tyranny, government would be divided into branches (executive, legislative, judicial) that would check and balance each other.
    
4. **Civic Virtue:** The system relied on a knowledgeable, engaged, and virtuous citizenry that would participate in public life and hold their leaders accountable.
    
5. **Equality Before the Law:** A radical departure from feudal systems where nobility had special privileges. The law was to be blind to status.
    

In this ideal, the system was designed to be a meritocracy of ideas, where the best policies would win through open debate and the will of an informed majority.

### Part 2: The Transition - Removing Monarchy and the Immediate Compromises

After removing or limiting monarchy, the founders of new systems faced a immediate, practical problem: **Who exactly is "the People"?**

- **The American Example:** Despite lofty language of equality, the U.S. Constitution initially codified slavery (the 3/5 Compromise), denied rights to Native Americans, and limited voting almost exclusively to white, male property owners. The elite of the time—landowners, merchants, lawyers—designed a system that, while revolutionary, also protected their own interests and property from what they saw as the "excesses" of the unpropertied masses. James Madison in _Federalist No. 10_ explicitly argued that the new republic's large size would help control the "mischief of faction," meaning it would dilute popular movements that could threaten the stability and property rights of the elite.
    
- **The French Example:** The French Revolution's cry of "Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité" was almost immediately followed by the Reign of Terror, demonstrating how the pursuit of pure popular will could lead to a new form of tyranny. This showed that a system needed structures to protect both from the tyranny of a single ruler _and_ the tyranny of the majority.
    

**From the very beginning, the system had a flaw: it was designed by an elite and contained mechanisms (however well-intentioned) that allowed for elite influence to persist.**

### Part 3: How and When the System Started to Be Exploited

There wasn't a single moment, but a gradual process of exploitation through several key vulnerabilities that were baked into the system:

1. **The Vulnerability of Capital:** Democracy requires money to function—for campaigns, messaging, and building political organizations. Those with wealth (the economic elite) quickly realized they could translate **economic power into political power**. This started subtly with lobbying and campaign donations in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
    
2. **The Rise of Organized Interest Groups (Factions):** Madison feared "factions," and he was right to. As industries grew, so did their need to influence government policy (tariffs, regulations, taxes). The first recorded lobbies in the U.S., like the railroad lobbies in the 19th century, were infamous for buying politicians and votes with cash and stock, leading to scandals like the Crédit Mobilier scandal (1867). This is one of the earliest **recorded, systematic exploitations** of the democratic process by a corporate elite.
    
3. **Information Asymmetry:** The ideal democracy requires an informed electorate. But those in power and those with resources have always had a greater ability to **control the narrative**. From the partisan newspapers of the 1800s to the invention of public relations (Edward Bernays in the 1920s pioneered propaganda techniques for corporations and government), the elite learned to shape public opinion to serve their interests, often without the public realizing it.
    
4. **The Iron Law of Oligarchy:** Sociologist Robert Michels coined this term in 1911. He argued that any large organization, including political parties and even democratic states, inevitably develops an elite (an oligarchy) that makes key decisions. The complexity of government requires specialization, which leads to a class of professional politicians and bureaucrats who become disconnected from the populace and develop their own interests to preserve their power.
    

### Part 4: The Modern System of Hidden Elite Rule

Today, the exploitation is not usually a secret conspiracy in a smoke-filled room (though networking happens in places like Davos). It's a **systemic and legalistic phenomenon:**

- **Lobbying & Campaign Finance:** Legalized channels for wealth to influence policy. Through Super PACs and dark money, vast sums can be spent to elect favorable candidates and pressure incumbents.
    
- **The Revolving Door:** Regulators and politicians who favor certain industries are rewarded with high-paying lobbying jobs after their public service, and vice-versa. This creates a fusion of corporate and state power.
    
- **Control of the Information Sphere:** Media consolidation means most major news outlets are owned by a handful of massive corporations. Furthermore, social media algorithms and targeted advertising allow for sophisticated manipulation of public discourse.
    
- **Complexity and Obfuscation:** Legislation is often thousands of pages long, written in legalese, with crucial details hidden in amendments. This makes it difficult for the public to monitor what is actually being passed and who it benefits.
    

### Who Was the First Recorded to Exploit It?

It's impossible to name a single person, but we can point to the **first well-documented _class_ of exploiters: the 19th-century Robber Barons and their political allies.**

- **Figures like:** Jay Gould (notorious for his manipulation of railroads and gold market), Cornelius Vanderbilt, and John D. Rockefeller.
    
- **Their Method:** They used their immense wealth to bribe state legislators and U.S. Congressmen outright to get favorable land grants, tariffs, laws, and to break strikes. The **Crédit Mobilier scandal** (1867) is a pristine early example where a railroad company bribed dozens of U.S. politicians with cash and shares to avoid government oversight of its fraudulent operations.
