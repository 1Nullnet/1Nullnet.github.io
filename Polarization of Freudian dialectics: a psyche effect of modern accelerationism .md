# polarization of Freudian dialectics: a psyche effect of modern accelerationism.




By my peculiar understanding of accelerationism, I have understood that it is necessary for the world to intensify the speed of capitalism, AI, techno-capital, and more in order to collapse and form a new world. This essay will show how the current modern world shows glimpses of the effects on the human psyche, and what will happen in the peak of an accelerationist society.

# Freudian Dialectics

Despite Freud had been criticized by many thinkers , and stated that his id , ego and superego model is non measurable , and speculative abstraction , i will use the concept to grasp the depth and as a collective metaphor .
According to Freudian psychoanalysis and his book _The Ego and the Id_,  
the id is the repressed, raw, and pleasure-seeking layer, whereas the superego (the ideal ego) is a layer which follows and is formed to satisfy the id by respectable, mannered means that satisfy societal norms/standards. It works by a guilt mechanism of not following the social rules, and channels down the id's desires into a socially acceptable action. The ego, for me, is not a pillar of the mind (which consists of only two of them: the superego and id) but a compiler or a mediator of the superego and id. It acts as a language translator bridge for the functioning architecture of the id and superego, as they are of fundamentally different natures.

In the human psyche, there is always a flux created because of this tension between the id and superego... to follow the desire or to follow social manners. For example, a person wants to rest (id) but he must work and be productive (the superego). The ego here will choose which nature to act upon as the most dominant in that situation, based on either rational, emotional, or other pre-existing reasons to choose one over the other.

This flux is always there, yet the ego somehow finds a way to decide what to choose over another, not making a fusion or synthesis as it cannot, for they are just two opposite natures.

**MY ARGUMENT:** It says that due to our modern growing speed of consumerism, exploitation, and techno-capital, we can see even now how the id and superego are being affected, and the ego is having friction in deciding what to choose. For example, Instagram's rapid notifications and likes serve the id, yet the societal voices of job, studies, and work serve the superego. Here, the ego feels a trembling of the plates, unsure of which to choose and which to ignore. It tries to negotiate with, "I will study, and then scroll Instagram," but both sides are intensifying, making it hard to decide. Soon, it decides not by any pre-established reasons but out of fast, quick, and sometimes fake reasons.

With accelerationism, this intensification becomes so great that it has a polarized effect on the dialectics. With this, it will be extremely hard to satisfy one over the other. It could also become a form of Buridan's ass paradox, where the rational donkey (the ego) cannot choose between two identically satisfying piles of hay (one the id and one the superego). This creates a crisis of the ego. This crisis of not being able to choose one over the other, where both are extremely intensified, creates either mental illness or a quick ego decision to pick one, causing a complete depletion or suppression of the other as a whole. If it chooses the id, it forgets a large amount of social standards and performs actions only to satisfy its desires and hunger, which can include crimes, robbery, aggression, impulsive responses, and many more solely self-driven actions. If it chooses the superego, it represses the id and follows only what society says, forgetting one's own self-perception

DARWINISM OF THOUGHTS AND SELF 

Darwin's theory of evolution and survival of the fittest points toward a trajectory for how the world would accelerate: new institutions forming, growth, decay, and all environmental and social changes affecting individual adaptation.

Either humans will fail to adapt to this fast-paced society, or their natural adaptation and learning from social cues will increase. Possibly, future generations (babies) could become hyper-aware, intake large amounts of information, and learn rapidly. Genetic mutations could also enhance cognitive capabilities and brain capacity to process large stimuli and thrive in such environments.

Yet, what if, before such adaptations occur—which is indeed possible—society crashes into severe existential dread? Handling extremes of the id and superego could make the ego static and indecisive, producing unclear actions and the constant question: “Now what?” This results from repressed and unprocessed poles of the psyche. with no clear direction of what to hold onto and constant flux , identity would also be distorted and reflecting small to no clear sense of self .
