MIND AS A RECURSION MACHINE 

ABSTRACT:** this essay goes into the mechanism of mind , as a perpetual machine , doing a continuous dynamic regulation of experiences and shaping our perception of reality with reference to Hegel's objectification of reality.

**CHAPTER 1: MECHANISM**

The mechanism is divided, like any other machine, into input --> logic ---> output. Here are the following steps :

**1) INPUT:** external reality ( the system which is both noumena and phenomena ) is continuous , it's dynamic and a very complex continuous network of infinite permutational events happening. This makes any information extracting system (brain) impossible to anticipate every continuous event and apply axioms to it. So as a solution, the brain is only a discontinuous system and chooses highly specific information to be extracted. It selects which pieces are taken in by pre-established blocks of beliefs, which can be nature, instinct, and identity.

**2) LOGIC:** it's the mechanism by which the system (brain) now works on the chosen piece of information. It does three particular steps:

**i) Transformation:** it transforms and anticipates the event piece chosen into a set of language or sensory input if language has not been already established (learned). We can think of it like a block of sentences and sensory inputs.

**ii) Storing:** it stores the block into the kernel. What's the kernel? The kernel is the continuous re-generating (breaking and fixing) sort of building the mind wants to make by installing many blocks.

**iii) Establishment of kernel:** when the block is now installed into the building (kernel), it builds the kernel each time. This kernel is fundamental as it governs the same loop of the reason behind choosing what information be extracted from that continuous dynamic reality.

In simple terms, if I explain, we can take an example of a baby girl. Without any visual and poetic explanation of details we can move onto the specific scenario. The baby girl has the natural installed instinct (safety, love, and love towards parents). Her father shouted at her. The baby girl extracts the piece of information from that continuous event by her pre-installed reason of safety. It extracts and changes it into language that says "who I loved the most didn't love me" and it is stored into her kernel. This also is dependent on how strongly it becomes the foundation of the kernel architecture on the repetition of the event. Now the girl is an adult. She even forgot that her father yelled at her; it's not in her conscious now but repressed into the unconscious. Now she has a partner. She feels anxiety and paranoia that her partner would leave her, doubt when he didn't give enough attention, love and match her expectation. The same block "who I loved the most didn't love me" plays here and is the same reason behind anticipating the partner's behavior through that lens.

In reality, the father loved the daughter; he shouted because he was frustrated from his work, tired, and angry. So as her partner, he isn't going to leave her. But it's all continuous reality; the mind only chooses to extract from the pre-installed blocks or lenses building the entire kernel.

This kernel is responsible for an individual's perception of reality. It governs how one walks, talks, acts, behaves, sees a girl, or a boy, how one perceives power, institutions, music taste, how one sits, dresses, thinks, reasons, dislikes and all behavior.

The mind is a perpetual loop because it extracts chosen nodes from the continuous reality (doesn't have to be true or false, like the father's situation of work and daughter) by pre-installed reasons, transforms into language and sensory data, stores into a block, builds the architecture of the kernel by more and more blocks, and the same deduced / extracted block is then used to perceive reality and act as the pre-installed reasons.

**CLARIFICATION OF TERMINOLOGIES USED**

**1) Pre-installed reasons:** are reasons behind why the mind extracts a particular information from the reality. In simple terms, a reason behind the anticipation of an event, how one sees it.

**2) Continuous reality:** the reality which is a fusion of Kant's phenomena and noumena ( what we know and what we can't). It's a reality which can only be seen with no categories installed; for example, we have the categories of time, space, etc. It's a complicated term as I define it myself. We can understand a glimpse by an example: imagine there is a cup on a table. We can look and decode the following easily such as its shape, colour, distance from us and many more. But in a continuous reality we doubt that even the cup we imagine in our mind, its shape, degree, its state of time (is it old, new?), its distance, the angle we are seeing it from and all are distorted and fused into one. It means the cup appears green, and blue, and old, new, broken, close, big, square and all forms and even more we can't even comprehend.

**3) Kernel:** in computer science the kernel is the fundamental architecture of the system and its most important element. So as in an analogy, the kernel is a building whose blocks are particular beliefs, and this kernel is used to shape our perception of reality.
