# The Thesis of Universal Solvability and the Relativity of "Problems"



# HOW I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS 

i was thinking on p vs np for months , and tried to understand whats the true meaning of soemthing to be SOLVABLE . I disliked the idea of using turing machine as the only
lense which tells us what is solvable and what not based on its internal working .
even Turing machine , is just a machine , a system which have flaws and errors that makes it not able to do certain tasks and problems .


An analogy : suppose there is a person A in a group , and A is considered genius , all members of group come with there problem and A  solves it , A is so useful for the group that ,
members thougt to make him a lense to know what we can solve and what not . After years a person B joins in group , more genius then A , he could solve problems A  couldn't so again , the members made
B as lense to know what we can solve and what not .

#### I say that why we even depdent on a machine or system to tell us what is solvable and not solvable at all , and how can we make a theory of work which is independent to any pre designed machine lense to distinguish what is solvable and what not .
## My hypothesis
begins with a fundamental principle: Every problem is solvable, provided it can be reduced to a set of consistent rules, laws, and axioms. A problem is unsolvable only when we lack the fundamental axioms necessary to frame it. Solvability is not an inherent property of a problem but a relationship between the problem and the axiomatic system in which it is considered.

Consider a state M—a configuration of data, a Turing machine's tape, or any system in a given condition. A solution to M is a string k that, when applied to M, resolves it according to a defined goal.

What, then, is solvability? It is the property that state M can be deconstructed into a set of fundamental axioms, A, that govern its behavior. The solvability of M within a specific system depends entirely on the relationship between set A and our "bounded system"—the finite set of known axioms and rules we currently possess.

If A is a subset of our bounded system, then the problem is solvable within that system. The solution k can be found using the rules we already have.

If A is not a subset of our bounded system, then the problem is not solvable within our current framework. However, it is solvable in principle. To solve it, we must discover or create new axioms, expanding the boundaries of our system.

The P vs. NP Problem Through This Lens
The P vs. NP question, under this view, is a question about our current, bounded axiomatic system. It asks whether, for a certain class of problems (NP), the solution string k can be found quickly (in polynomial time) using only the rules and axioms we currently accept.

P = NP would mean that for these problems, the set A needed to find solution k is already a subset of our bounded system; we just haven't discovered the efficient algorithm yet. The fundamental "shortcut" exists within our current mathematics.

P ≠ NP would mean that for at least some of these problems, the set A required for efficient solution lies outside our current bounded system. Solving them efficiently would require new, fundamental mathematical insights—new axioms.

# The Unbound Machine Gamma and Absolute Solvability
The limitation of the Turing machine model is that it is itself a "bounded system" defined by a specific set of rules. To define solvability based on a model is to be perpetually restricted. We create new models (quantum computers, etc.) to solve new problems, but this only changes the reference frame for what is considered solvable.

We must instead consider solvability independent of models. Imagine an unbound machine, Gamma, which possesses all possible rules, laws, and axioms—those we know, and those we don't, just as Socrates existed without knowledge of quantum mechanics. If you input any state M into Gamma, it is always solvable. Gamma simply accesses the correct set A from the universe of all logical possibilities and applies it.

# Conclusion
Therefore, the statement "Problem M is unsolvable" is not an absolute truth. It is a relative statement meaning "M is unsolvable within our current, bounded axiomatic system." Universal solvability is the default state. Our journey in mathematics and science is not one of encountering truly unsolvable puzzles, but of expanding our bounded system—our collection of axioms—until the set A for any given M falls within it. The Turing machine defines the horizon of what is solvable today; but the horizon is not the boundary of the world.
