# A THEORETICAL MODEL OF A DATA SECURITY MACHINE 


THIS IS A MACHINE WHICH WORKS ON THE CONCEPT OF RANDOMNESS , AND AS WE CANNOT PREDICT THE RANDOM , HENCE WE CANNOT BREACK THIS MACHINE . 
In very simple , it works like this --> with every wrong error , the whole code changes randomly ..hence which is bullet proof from brute force ,
AI learning models and even quantum computers because it works on randomness.

I got this idea , in a dream , which was : A mosquito wants to go to te end of a plane horizontal road , but the road consits of say 10 traps 
each trap in neutral condition . The mosquito moves , and wants to cross all the traps , with each trap having pre installed logic , that the trap have to move up or down 

say trap 1 have logic to move up ..and so on ... 

the mosquito dosen't know what these traps logics are , are they going to move up or down , so the mosquito have to be in a 50 - 50 scenario with each trap 

But the twist is that the mosquito we call ALPHA , can re born and start again , so with each failure he learns ok ( eg this trap 4 moves up so i have to move down now , earlier i moved up and lost ) 
by this try and error he learns and form the code , and now reached the end 

What if the traps , are not following a constant logic , with each error , all the logics of the traps are now changed , now if alpha reborns , all his learning and patterns he made earlier are now of no use 

all the traps configurations are fully changed .. so with each error , and try .. will alpha reach the end , if all the traps are changing with each error ?


This was the question that i wanted to answer 

well i came up with that , if the number of traps are small like 3 or 4 ..after tries it could crack it , but with even 10 , it won't the number of tries would be large , and with a million traps it would be an enormous task to do with even a quantum computer 




## ARCHITECTURE 

1) #### THE INPUT
   We store , informational data.. such as videos , text , codes , media etc

2) #### THE MECHANICSM OF PROCESS

   THE MECHANSIM is the curcial part , it is disected into :
   - TRAPS : Traps are switches , they have a binary output such as up or down , or 0 or 1
   - THE QUANTUM RANDOM NUMBER GENRATOR :  Is a device which uses the fundamental laws of physics to produce truely random number . Most of the RGN produces purely two random numbers ( 0 and 1) such as the Photon Beam Splitter
  
     why i am using a random genrator ? Its for the traps , to be random ... a deeper clarity -->


     imagine a person A , holding a coin have a duty to change the logics of trap with each mistakes alpha makes ...

     alpha makes a mistakes ..dies and reborn ... now in middle of this time ... A  goes to each trap and flips a coin ( with head the traps change into up if tails the trap will change into down )
     say if the trap 6 have logic to move down , and A flips the coin ..and gets tails which says change into down ... trap 6 logic will be same it will be down only as before

     but the problem with the coin toss , is that we can predict it after millions of simulations , and get into a narrowed probability and know the trap logics

     so for this problem i choose , quantum random number genrator which acts the same what A did , going to each trap , and change there logic , but instead of coin toss , it uses the pure random
- THE OUTPUT :

  with each mistake , traps changes , with pure randomness . This creates a resistance towards AI , Pattern recognations , and even quantum computer , because it works on the principle of randomness

  if u can predict the random , u can predict the future ... as then u can predict how each atom would move , combine , and react and how this would result in the change of the object ..which is equal to knowing the future



  ### ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS


  Its a powerful machine , i will not and cannot provide a full blueprint and how to make it .

  The system is theoretically unbreackable , but in practice i know making and building it would have engineering errors , human errors , etc ..also human trust exploitations happens , insiders working in it would be a victim of a third party etc

  but theoretically it is full proof unbreackable ..i know i must be in grandiose , and i am aware that every system have gaps , yet this machine is based on the very principle of nature , and if you can crack it , nature then by concept is flawed then .. all physics is wrong then ..

  as of now we cant predict randomness so for that time this machine is very safe for data .
