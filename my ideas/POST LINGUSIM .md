# POST LINGUSIM : MEME AS A NEW LANGAUGE 


I have thought this idea a very while ago , and realised that society ( espacially modern youths ) are uisng memes , as more then just a funny joke but 
like a language 

memes have all the fundamentals which makes a language ,

SUCH AS :

1) communcaiton
   
   Ideas , feelings , and thoughts must be communicable , and memes shows this very effectively . We use memes as a social inclusion to get into a group , to understand , indivuials shares memes to communicate complex feelings and ideas.
   Sending a meme , and if one doesn't get it feels like a language barrier and a exclusion , or a not our type person .. so many try to be updated with curent memes and trends to be understood and also understand what everyone are talking about .
3) ease

   Memes are very easy , to make , form , and even share ... it stores very minmal information , not many connected nodes , and very compresss result of a complicated concept .
   which in cause , evolutionary pricniples says that humans tend to do less work and save energy so ... this ease of communcaition , not much cognitive load , and instant rewards replaces any other language better.
   Other languages like hindi , english , russian etc , feels much more complex , long , and a lot of load in contrast of memes
5) connectivity

   Memes are very much connected and wide spread , it travels through all the countries and states , like a vrius and infect everyone minds and alters them very quickly its rewarding because of
   uniquness of meme , social reward ( oh you know this meme , me too ) , and a medium to express thoughts in place of a meme.
