# LAW AS A DYNAMIC AND EVER EVOLVING SYSTEM TO CONTAIN MASSES 

I thought about this idea because i asked myself : 

WHY NEW LAWS ARE MADE , MANY ARE CHANGED , EVEN PREVIOUSLY FULLY ACCEPTED LAWS ARE DISCARED , WHY ?

THE ANSWER WAS : 

Law is a reflection of collective conciosuness of the society , it reflect what the masses thinks , and believed at . When the masses concious are chnaged 
due to a revolution , paradgim shift ,enlightenment or a innovation which results in changing of the law . As think of law like a big conatiner , containing homogenous liquid( same beliefs )
now a new beleif is added , a reaction happens in the liquid and its properties changed 


this chnage in properties result an effect on the conatiner storing it , the liquid starts cracking the container , flowing off from top etc .
so to still conatin the liquid despite its properties are changed, we must build and upgrade our old container into a new container which can properly 
store the liquid without over flow , cracks , gaps etc .

The same concept apply to masses , for example current laws are thinking and making laws about AI ethics , deep fake media ethics , cybersecurity , 
etc  by this we can see that new masses concious is now towards technology , discord , instagram , etc form cults , and even notorious groups .. so a new 
door of unchecked exploiation have appread and we must make laws to control it and to check it .

This is very curcial for law to evolve at the same rate as the masses concious updates to control and regulate unchecked new potential gaps.

If this doest happens , law will be useless , its main objective to control and regulate masses would not be achived as the whole society changed , and we cannot use old version of control 
it must use same modern upgrades and adapt as quickly as possible to not let the liquid to harm the container and over flow
