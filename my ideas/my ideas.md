# HERE I STORE AND WORK ON ALL OF MY IDEAS 


[CBT AS A HISTORICAL FUNDAMENTAL ](https://github.com/1Nullnet/1Nullnet.github.io/blob/ideas/my%20ideas/cbt%20and%20history.md) This idea says that how cbt ( cognitive behavioural therapy ) which is basicaly an indivual restricted and change negative belefs .. i stretched
 it into a more mass scale of how mass belifs are changed which changes history 


 
[on solvability of problems ](https://github.com/1Nullnet/1Nullnet.github.io/blob/ideas/my%20ideas/ON%20SOLVABILITY%20OF%20PROBLEMS%20.md) This is a very idea if extended could form a new theory or branch of theoretical computer science ,which will not just deal with what is solvable , but how can we define solvability independent of any machine ( eg turing machine ) , and in this theory we will not be hopeless that this problem is unsolavable but we would know that if it cant be solved 


no problem it will be solved in more extended axioms of knowledge , we will make and find what new extension and findings we have to make to solve this problem


[exploitation and dispersion of human epstimes ](https://github.com/1Nullnet/1Nullnet.github.io/blob/ideas/my%20ideas/EXPLOITATION%20AND%20DISPERSION%20OF%20HUMAN%20EPISTEMES%20.md) This idea , is a form of thesis i made with observation of history and modern world , of how when new tech , innovation and ideas are chnaged into power and mass discipline system 



[words are revolution ](https://github.com/1Nullnet/1Nullnet.github.io/blob/ideas/my%20ideas/WORDS%20ARE%20REVOLUTION%20.md)  Here i show my thesis idea , that how words are not just symbols or a abstract concept we give meaning too , but it changes societies , laws , mass beliefs etc 


[synthesis of system and symmetry] This is a work which i want to work on as it merges the system ( rational , logical , systmatic self ) to an symmetry ( emotional , feelings , subjective experience ) why i want to merge them ..as i thought these two are most extreme poles , many consider to be logical and supress emotions , and many take emotions before logics .. i want to make a synthesis that why both are important for existence and to percive reality 


[evolution and dynamics of law](https://github.com/1Nullnet/1Nullnet.github.io/blob/ideas/my%20ideas/DYNAMICS%20OF%20LAW%20AND%20EVOLUTION%20.md) This work crtiques HART  concept of law , as also many think of law as just rules and writtings but it is a dynamic evolving mirror of masses living in a society 


[wave medium theory of leibniz monad](https://github.com/1Nullnet/1Nullnet.github.io/blob/ideas/my%20ideas/wave%20medium%20and%20LEIBNIZ%20MONADS.md) An extension of leibniz Monadology into a dynamic and a wave like structure for better understanding of reality
