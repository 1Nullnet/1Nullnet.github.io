[CBT AS A HISTORICAL FUNDAMENTAL ](https://github.com/1Nullnet/1Nullnet.github.io/blob/ideas/my%20ideas/cbt%20and%20history.md) This idea says that how cbt ( cognitive behavioural therapy ) which is basicaly an indivual restricted and change negative belefs .. i stretched
 it into a more mass scale of how mass belifs are changed which changes history 


 
[on solvability of problems ](https://github.com/1Nullnet/1Nullnet.github.io/blob/ideas/my%20ideas/ON%20SOLVABILITY%20OF%20PROBLEMS%20.md) This is a very idea if extended could form a new theory or branch of theoretical computer science ,which will not just deal with what is solvable , but how can we define solvability independent of any machine ( eg turing machine ) , and in this theory we will not be hopeless that this problem is unsolavable but we would know that if it cant be solved 


no problem it will be solved in more extended axioms of knowledge , we will make and find what new extension and findings we have to make to solve this problem


[exploitation and dispersion of human epstimes ](https://github.com/1Nullnet/1Nullnet.github.io/blob/ideas/my%20ideas/EXPLOITATION%20AND%20DISPERSION%20OF%20HUMAN%20EPISTEMES%20.md) This idea , is a form of thesis i made with observation of history and modern world , of how when new tech , innovation and ideas are chnaged into power and mass discipline system
