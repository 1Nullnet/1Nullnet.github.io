# EXPLOITATION AND DISPERSION OF HUMAN EPISTEMES

## THIS IS AN INITIAL THESIS IDEA FROM AN OBSERVATION I MADE ACROSS HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND THEIR EXPLOITATIONS FOR POWER

THE THESIS STATES : Any new knowledge , technology or innovation done not solely with an intent to control and as a form of power , but done by compassion and to grow the human boundary of knowledge ...will sooner or later be used , as a medium to control and discipline masses .

we can see the examples in printing press innovation ... it was made for mass production of writings , to spread one's idea and thoughts challenging monarchs and beliefs ... was then used as a tool for propaganda , mass manipulation , and to also spread false information ,
TV , created for entertainment , channels and to see what's happening in the world visually ...was then used by NAZIS for propaganda , and antisemitic ideologies ..

we can see many more examples throughout history and it's not just ... technology or a mechanical innovation but also books and pieces of knowledge .
such as FREUD'S initial concepts for ### psychoanalysis
was completely different from the original dream of Freud , how he thought and made his theories ... his works were compartmentalized , given to universities ... an hoarding of knowledge ..which Freud never wanted ..THERAPY was given to elites , at high cost ..
his works on sexuality were misinterpreted ..and made like a mental illness in earlier DSM 5 ..

even creation of medicines , and cure of illness initially thought to help people .. was structured , given to elites , high cost , the information of making it was contained within powers ..

we can see many patterns throughout history of how new compassion driven expansion of human societies , are twisted , broken , and exploited in terms to use as power and mass discipline


## CURRENT PREDICTION OF INNOVATION EXPLOITATIONS

we can see how AI , thought and properly defined by Alan Turing mathematically , Shannon's works on information theory and many more collaborative works on the development of AI .. was made .. for the need to ease humans repetitive works , predictions , and estimations ... but now we can see how AI is used in social media
algorithms , data surveillance control over moves , and changing perception of reality ...

by this we can predict the
##### TRAJECTORY OF FUTURE CONTROL AND EXPLOITATIONS OF QUANTUM COMPUTING AND RELATED NICHE RESEARCH
which are currently theoretical as then was AI ...
this could be also exploited as it's highly fast , powerful machine ..would be capable of even changing brain neural pathways , mapping of networks , sociological changes and predictions only held by a few .. this could be more severe reality distortion than even AI
