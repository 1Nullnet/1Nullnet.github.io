# ROBERT FROST AND CAPITALISM 

I was reading frost work "A ROADSIDE STAND" , and realised that how much FROST dislikes the idea of capitalism 
which includes the promise made to poors about the success of doing buissness , authority and rich exploit shopekeppers , they just stop their car to ask direction , gas , and the rate 
But no one buy anything from them 

frost shows a dream to change this system , and give a meaningful happiness to the poor and the farmers , but he end with a sight and a hopeless feeling that he can't change it totally by himself .

"A Roadside Stand" is far more than a poem of rustic sympathy. It is a complex work of social criticism that aligns Frost with thinkers critical of capitalismâ€™s human cost. Through its dramatic tension, ironic language, and profound conclusion,
the poem argues that the unchecked advance of a capitalist modernity systemically devastates rural life, not only through poverty but by
fostering a deep, spiritual alienation. Frost demonstrates that the greatest cruelty of the system may not be its indifference, but its false promises and its destruction of the very hope it claims to inspire.
