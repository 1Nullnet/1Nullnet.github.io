# HERE I CONNECT AND FORM A NEW LAYERED PERSPECTIVE OF MY IDEAS , OBSERVATION AND THOUGHTS

CONNECTING [ solvability of problems with instituitonal manipulation] here i merge my two works ( i will add in the link ) , extending that how institutuion is just a bounded sysmtem with fundamental axioms , the solvable is 
whatever which can be solved within the institution limits . 


[robert frost and capitalism](https://github.com/1Nullnet/1Nullnet.github.io/blob/connections/connections%20made/frost%20and%20capitalism%20.md) i have drawn a connection between frost poem reflecting his dislike towards capitalism

[dyssion and annihilation](https://github.com/1Nullnet/1Nullnet.github.io/blob/connections/connections%20made/DYSSION%20AND%20ANNHILATION%20OF%20SELF.md) Extended framework for understanding violent mind

[institution and solvability theory](https://github.com/1Nullnet/1Nullnet.github.io/blob/connections/connections%20made/Institution%20and%20axioms.md)
Here i have linked and made an extensive framework of how institutions are also set of axioms , and human society , beliefs are all just shaped by axioms feeded in our mind . Also showing how to think outside the institutional system boundry and not be controlled.
