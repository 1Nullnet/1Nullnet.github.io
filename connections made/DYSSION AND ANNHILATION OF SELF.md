# DYSSION AND ANNHILATION OF SELF : BIRTH OF A CRIMINAL MIND ( EXTENDED FRAMEWORK)

I have added an extension to my earlier concept []
and added the concept of DYSSION

WHAT IS THIS DYSSION ?  AND WHY ITS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND A CRIMINAL MIND 

DYSSION i made a word which is a result of combining “dissonance” and  “tension”

SO DYSSION .. is a dissocance and tension between the idea of " WHO AM I "  and " WHO I WANT TO BE "  are two oppsing poles .

It arises by self hatred ( who i am ) and the realization ( who i can be or want to be in order to disporve and run of the hatred of who i am ) 
creates a never resolving loop of conflict that come in place of rage , frustation towards self and others who are associated in a degree towards the two poles

often if one self accepts , still society , and people could make it to the surface again in a negative sense 

A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE : 

 a person mocked , and always blamed of trumatic consequences would most probably started believing that yes it was my fault ..which then goes into self hatred ..

in order to reclaim the hatred mind starts thinking in an other direction to resolve the hatred by giving a chance to change it ..but mostly it comes out of rage or frustation to disporve the self hatred belief .

in the hypothetical case above the person could be also rejected when he tries to disporve his self hatred beleif ..example he could desire for becoming powerful as a mean to disprove that he was his fault ,
but he faced rejection , and lose that he cant even change ..so the mind negatively accepts the self hatred into a suprressed function of mind not in a self help like " ACCEPT YOUR MISTAKE "  no but as a punishment which outward into violent acts which satisfy the poles
